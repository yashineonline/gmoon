#jobcycle_agent

Add a simple Streamlit UI (optional, if you want to test in browser)

Add JSON job dataset for even smarter matching

Optional: Email or PDF export of job suggestions

run the following:

streamlit run foodcycle_ai/app.py

Add screenshots of the app running to the README

Use a streamlit.io or Hugging Face Spaces demo (optional)

Tag your repo with #streamlit, #openai, #gpt, #civictech

Once pushed to GitHub, you can show recruiters or founders:

“You can clone this and run streamlit run app.py right now.”

Add a small image or gif showing the MVP in action:

![App Screenshot](./screenshots/parkoptimizr_demo.png)
Or host a short Loom/video link or Streamlit Cloud link for live demo:

Live Demo on Streamlit Cloud

in requirements.txt for human-plus-platform
folium or leaflet.js (via frontend) → if you want map rendering

to do
Add a leaderboard or credit system for eco-pedaling - gym near parking, e.g. laurier university, waterloo, to charge cars
was this done: Integrate with battery disposal points, car sharing, and microgrids

to merge the legal and citation
and even ask deepseek all the steps i did to use that 
to build an agent that writes a full research review paper 


TO ADD AS NOTE ON GITHUB TO SHOW HOW CODE OPTIMIZED:

updated with more explicit, type-safe, and future-proof code for agentic workflows.

Type Safety: Uses a TypedDict (JobState) to define the state schema, making the workflow more robust and self-documenting.
Explicit END: Uses END for the finish point, which is clearer and more idiomatic in LangGraph.
Extensibility: The state schema makes it easier to add or modify workflow steps in the future.
Readability: The structure is clearer, especially for teams or future maintainers.

from typing import TypedDict, List
from agentic_workflow import collect_profile, extract_skills, match_jobs

# Define the state schema
class JobState(TypedDict):
    profile_data: str

# Define the flow graph
def build_job_graph():

    builder.add_node("collect_profile", collect_profile)
    builder.add_node("extract_skills", extract_skills)
    builder.add_node("match_jobs", match_jobs)
    builder.set_entry_point("collect_profile")

    builder.add_edge("collect_profile", "extract_skills")
    builder.add_edge("extract_skills", "match_jobs")
    builder.add_edge("match_jobs", END)

    return builder.compile()

lesson 2:
The line:
```python
from langchain.agents import Tool, initialize_agent, AgentType
```
is no longer needed in your code because:

---

### **Why It’s Not Needed:**

- **You are not using LangChain Agents.**
  - Your code directly uses `LLMChain` and prompt templates to process data in a stepwise fashion.
  - There is no use of `Tool`, `initialize_agent`, or `AgentType` in your workflow.
  - The functions (`collect_profile`, `extract_skills`, `match_jobs`) are called directly by your LangGraph flow, not by a LangChain agent.

- **LangGraph manages the workflow.**
  - LangGraph orchestrates the flow between your functions, so you don’t need to initialize or configure a LangChain agent.

- **No tools are being registered or used.**
  - The `Tool` class is for defining callable tools for agents, which is not present in your code.

### **Summary Table**

| Import Line                                      | Needed? | Why/Why Not?                                      |
|--------------------------------------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------|
| from langchain.agents import Tool, ...           | ❌      | No agent or tool logic in your code               |
| from langchain.llms, langchain_community, etc.   | ✅      | Needed for LLMs, chains, and prompt templates     |

---

**In short:**  
You are using direct LLM chains and a graph workflow, not the agent abstraction—so you can safely remove that import.
