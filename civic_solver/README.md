# 🧠 CivicSolver: AI for Daily Life Improvements

## 💡 Purpose
- Many local issues go unresolved:
  - Missed mail
  - Delayed garbage pickup
  - Parking confusion
  - Utility overcharges

## 📦 MVP Flow
1. User inputs complaint or optimization idea
2. GPT analyzes and suggests solutions
3. Routes suggestion to relevant org/contact (even if via email template)

## 🔌 Tools
- GPT-4 API or Langchain agent (for routing logic)
- City contact directory API or custom dataset
- Streamlit + form UI

## 🌐 Vision
Make this a bridge between people’s needs and civic systems—powered by AI.
