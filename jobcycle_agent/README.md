## 📍 Example Use Case

### 🚀 `app.py`
```python
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, load_tools
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
tools = load_tools(["wikipedia", "llm-math"], llm=llm)
agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent="zero-shot-react-description")

response = agent.run("What kind of job fits someone skilled in carpentry, driving, and electrical wiring?")
```

---

## Testing 
```python
from langgraph_config import build_job_graph

graph = build_job_graph()
initial_state = {
    "profile_data": "I have 5 years experience as an electrician and also did part-time carpentry and delivery driving."
}
result = graph.invoke(initial_state)
print(result)
```



## Full Feature Checklist for JobCycle Agent

#### 1. Build the dataset matching logic
- Implement logic to match user profiles with job datasets

#### 2. Add Firebase backend for job tracking
- Integrate Firebase to store and track job applications

#### 3. Build the resume parser into the UI
- Add a resume upload feature and parse resumes for skills and experience

📄 Code for Resume Upload (PDF → Text)
```python
import pdfplumber

uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload resume (PDF)", type=["pdf"])
if uploaded_file:
    with pdfplumber.open(uploaded_file) as pdf:
        text = "\n".join(page.extract_text() for page in pdf.pages)
    st.text_area("Parsed Resume", value=text[:2000])
```


#### 4. Scoring & Ranking Job Matches
- Compare user profile skills against each job in the dataset
- Assign a score based on skill match percentage
- Rank jobs by highest score and display the top 3

#### 5. Explainability
- Use GPT to explain why each job was recommended
- Add a toggle: “Why this match?”

#### 6. Feedback Loop for Better Matches
- Let users rate the job matches (👍 / 👎)
- Store feedback in Firebase or local JSON
- Retrain or fine-tune match logic (optional future step)

#### 7. Persistent Job History (Optional Database Layer)
- Use Firebase, Supabase, or SQLite
- Save submitted profiles and matched jobs per user session

#### 8. Email or Notification
- Allow users to receive job matches via email (using SMTP or EmailJS)
- Add button: “Email My Matches”

#### 9. Mobile Responsiveness
- Ensure the UI works well on phones (Streamlit handles this reasonably)
- Add “Copy Job Match” button for sharing via text message or WhatsApp

#### 10. Admin Dashboard
- Show number of job submissions, match success rate
- Visualize common skills using bar chart or word cloud

#### 11. Authentication (optional)
- Add simple password or Firebase Auth for persistent user sessions

#### 12. Deploy Online
- Use Streamlit Community Cloud or Hugging Face Spaces
- Include public demo link in README

## 🗂️ Add-ons

### 🌍 Multi-language Support
```python
from langchain.tools.translate import GoogleTranslateTool
```

- Add a language switch dropdown to app.py.
- Detect input language → translate → process.
